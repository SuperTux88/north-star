These are the changes made to diaspora\*'s codebase during January. They will take effect with the release of **diaspora\* v0.5.0.0**.

Say a big thank you to everyone who has helped improve diaspora* this month!

This  list has been created by volunteers from the diaspora* community. We'd  love help in creating a development review each month; if you would like  to help us, get in touch via the [related thread on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/rcQeDaEf/monthly-development-review).

### **Faldrian** [@Faldrian](https://github.com/Faldrian)
* added an environment variable to specify the Firefox version for our test suite: [#5584](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5584). The test suite sometimes has problems with recent Firefox versions, which can lead to failing tests when running the test suite on your own computer.

### **Steffen van Bergerem** [@svbergerem](https://github.com/svbergerem)
* removed unused code from the ProfileHeaderView: [#5472](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5472)
* ported the contacts page to Backbone.js: [#5473](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5473). This implements client-side rendering of the contact list, which should speed up page load times.
* replaced the markdown renderer pagedown by markdown-it: [#5526](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5526), [#5541](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5541), [#5543](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5543), [#5545](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5545) and [#5574](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/5574)

This release was scheduled for this weekend. However, a [security issue in Nokogiri](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1714) has recently been announced, so we decided to release early. Over the past six weeks, we have managed to collect **26 commits** made by **5 contributors** for this minor release.

A huge thanks to all the contributors from diaspora\*'s amazing community!

title: diaspora* version 0.5.6.0 released

Due to the delays in freezing this version, our latest minor release is being released slightly later than scheduled.

Over the past six weeks, we have managed to collect **62 commits** made by **11 contributors** for this minor release. This is smaller than recent releases, but we are still happy to get it out since it contains a fix that will affect some people.

A huge thank-you to all the contributors from diaspora\*'s amazing community! If you want to help make diaspora\* even better, please check out [our getting started guide](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Getting_started_with_contributing). Please see [the changelog](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases/tag/v0.5.6.0) for a complete list of changes made in this release.

### Notable Changes

* media.ccc.de is now a trusted oEmbed provider.
* Hovercards will no longer redirect you to the sign-in form if you are on a remote pod.

A lot of work is going on in the next major version (**0.6.0.0**), too! You should check that out if you are interested.

### Updating

Update instructions are available as usual in [the wiki](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Updating). For those of you who have been testing the release candidate, run `git checkout master` before the update to get back to the stable release branch.

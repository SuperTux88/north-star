We're pleased to announce a new major version of diaspora*, which includes 302 commits from 29 contributors.

Here are the new features in this version:

* It is now possible to add a poll to your message: an easy way to get answers to your questions!
* You can now report a post or a comment to the podmin by clicking the exclamation point icon. Use it to signal inappropriate content, such as spam.
* The notifications page has been completely redesigned. You can now filter notifications by type, and show only read or unread notifications. The notifications dropdown in the header bar has also been improved: it now displays some text from the post and provides a better way to mark notifications as read.
* The mobile view has been improved and now includes a drawer which provides easy access to every page. Icons are more visible and easier to click, and the search field is directly accessible.
* Hovercards are now available on bootstrap pages (currently single-post view, conversations page, notifications page).
* The single-post view and the conversation page designs have been improved.
* There have also been many bug fixes and much refactoring work completed. Find out more about them in [the changelog](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases/tag/v0.4.0.0).
